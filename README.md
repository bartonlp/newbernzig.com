# This is the home of newbernzig.com.

This site has been redone and all of the php files work.

In the 'images' directory there are a number of symlinks to '../../tysonweb/images'. I have copied the following phps from 
tysonweb to here and reworked them a little so they have the newbernzip.com header. The files are:

    Ariport.php
    New-Bern-Civilwar.php
    New-Bern-dining.php
    New-Bern-history2.php
    New-Bern-nc-history.php
    New-Bern-dining.php

The symlinks are the images that are in the same named file in tysonweb.
